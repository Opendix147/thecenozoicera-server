Server setup guide

Inside a sperate folder you can find images that follow each step below incase you get lost

First step is to extract the Server folder within this file


Once extracted open the Server folder

Navigate to TheCenozoicEraServer.exe

Right click the .exe -> Create Shortcut. Make sure the shortcut is created within the Server folder.

Note: If you use Windows 11 you may have to click "Show more options" at the bottom of the window when right clicking
Right click on the newly created shortcut -> Properties

Once inside properties you want to edit the Target line, make sure you are all the way at the end of the text field

Paste in the following: Port=(X)?QueryPort=(X)?MaxPlayers=(Players) -log -game -server

(Make sure to add a space at the end of the target line before pasting in the above text)

Port=(X) Make sure to replace the (X) with your port number. Example Port=210191 Samething for QueryPort=(X)

MaxPlayers=(Players) make sure to replace (Players) with the amount of players you want. Example MaxPlayers=100

If you need help understanding what ports to use and how to forward them you will need to look up a separate
tutorial for ports


Once finished, launch the new created shortcut file and allow the server to run for a short time
Note: It will error, that's fine, this is creating the required files needed for final server setup
If prompted click "Allow"

After you see the log window stops scrolling, close it down and head to:
TheCenozoicEraServer\Server\TheCenozoicEra\Saved\Config\WindowsServer

Paste in the included Game.ini file and edit the fields as needed
